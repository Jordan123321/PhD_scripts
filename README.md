# PhD_scripts
The series of scripts that I've used to to do my PhD analysis
A lot of the earlier work is written somewhat inefficiently as I was learning to programme then
In approx chronological order, I'll lay out what each of these files does
Cell_count_3.py reads the images, identifies the cells and the cell boundaries, then statistically compares the cell numbers between healthy and diabetic patients, by producing tables and graphs
VorSplit.py is adapted from scipy and is built upon the QHull framework. It conducts a fast vornoin split around a set of points on a canvas
Network_#.py files are for imposing networks on the images and analysing the underlying network structures
